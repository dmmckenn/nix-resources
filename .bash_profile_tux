#  
# Initial bash profile for new accounts
#
# Department of Computer Science, Princeton University
#
# This file should be named .bashrc and .bash_profile in your home directory.
# It is read ONCE when you login in order to set up your environment and
# then EVERY time you start a new bash. Your .bash_profile file is read
# INSTEAD of your .login file. Enter 'man bash' for an explanation of the
# bash shell and of the .bash_profile, .bashrc, and other configuration files.
#
# You can customize this file for your own use. There are two types of
# changes you can make: those which override system defaults set in the
# file /usr/local/etc/bashrc.all and those which do not conflict with
# any of those settings. Don't override the defaults lightly; the system
# administrators set them for a reason. But override them, instead of
# deleting all of them outright, so changes made later to bashrc.all to
# support a new application will work for you, too.

#
# To add/change something which is NOT a system default, put your changes HERE:
#

#
# System default values are set by the following line:
#
source /usr/local/etc/bashrc.all       # DO NOT DELETE THIS LINE, PLEASE

#
# To change a system default, put your changes HERE:
#
#  For example, to add to the default system paths uncomment and use
#   the following construction:
#
#if [ -z ${USER_ENV} ]; then
#   export PATH=${PATH}:/add/paths/here
#   export USER_ENV=TRUE
#fi


#  uncomment and add aliases for interactive shells here
#
if [ -n "${PS1}" ]; then

                        # Uncomment to undo our good intentions

#   unset ignoreeof     # will not log you out with <ctrl-d>
#   unset noclobber     # to keep you from erasing files unknowingly
	                # when using '>' (output redirection)
#   unalias rm          # remove will ask before removing files
#   unalias mv          # move will ask before moving files on top of others
